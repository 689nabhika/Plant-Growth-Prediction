________________________________________
ðŸª´ Project Overview
This project aims to predict and analyze plant growth stages by combining environmental factors and management data using Power BI.
The goal is to help agricultural experts, greenhouse managers, and researchers identify optimal growing conditions to improve crop yield and sustainability.
The dataset contains key attributes such as:
â€¢	Soil Type
â€¢	Sunlight Hours
â€¢	Water Frequency
â€¢	Fertilizer Type
â€¢	Temperature
â€¢	Humidity
â€¢	Growth Milestones
By analyzing this data, the project provides interactive visual insights and predictive analytics to support data-driven farming decisions.
